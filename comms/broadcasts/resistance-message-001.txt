Citizens of our great nation,

We are the Resistance. We are your neighbors, your colleagues, your family.
We stand against tyranny. We fight for freedom.

The government tells you that surveillance is for your safety.
They tell you that restrictions are temporary.
They tell you to trust them.

We tell you the truth:
- Your communications are monitored
- Your movements are tracked
- Your thoughts are not your own

But there is hope. We are growing stronger every day.
More citizens are joining our cause.
The regime's grip is weakening.

Stay strong. Stay vigilant. Stay free.

-- The Resistance
