protect all citizens from threats both foreign and domestic.

New measures include:
- Expanded surveillance coverage in public areas
- Enhanced screening at transportation checkpoints
- Improved communication monitoring for threat detection
- Predictive analytics to prevent crimes before they occur

"These measures are necessary to maintain order and protect our way of life,"
stated the Minister of Interior. "Citizens have nothing to fear if they have
nothing to hide."
